<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Joe. I have worked in the petroleum industry for 20 plus years.  I grew up in a small texas town far 
  from the big city.  As a teenager I learned a little Dos at school.  computers were not available to us outside of
  school since they were to expensive so computing was only a curiosity.  
</p>

<p>My town is well known for producing pipefitters and welders.  Many of my peers went on to work in these trades.  
  I myself started as a pipefitter apprentice but quickly changed to a career as a reactor technician.  
  The allure of travel pushed me into this career and I must say, it didn't disappoint.  Now that I am on the verge of 
  retiring from the petrochemical industry, I am choosing to become a web developer.  
</p>

<p>Some question whether I can secure a position in programing or coding.  I question it myself, however I have always 
  wanted to learn the skill and whenever I get free time, I will learn the skills necessary to enter this field.
